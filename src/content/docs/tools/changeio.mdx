Create a folder in which to place the changeio data.

You can create a first file named `docker-compose.yml` and put the following content in it

<ShowCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/refs/heads/main/changeio/docker-compose.yml" title="docker-compose.yml" language="yml" />

Once the configuration is complete, you can run the following command

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
