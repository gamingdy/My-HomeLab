:::caution
The following guide assumes you've used my reverse proxy setup, if not you can find it <a href="/tools/nginx-proxy/">here</a>
:::

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Create a folder in which to place the monitoring tools data.

You can create a first file named `docker-compose.yml` and put the following content in it

export const response = await fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/main/monitor/docker-compose.yml");
export const content = await response.text();

<Code code={content} lang="yml" title="docker-compose.yml" />

You need to create a folder named `prometheus` inside of this folder you will put the following file

export const responsePrometheusConfig = await fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/main/monitor/prometheus/prometheus.yml");
export const contentPrometheusConfig = await responsePrometheusConfig.text();

<Code code={contentPrometheusConfig} lang="yml" title="prometheus.yml" />

Once the configuration is complete, you can run the following command

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
