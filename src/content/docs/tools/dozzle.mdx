Create a folder in which to place the dozzle data.

You can create a first file named `docker-compose.yml` and put the following content in it

export const response = await fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/refs/heads/main/dozzle/docker-compose.yml");
export const content = await response.text();

<Code code={content} lang="yml" title="docker-compose.yml" />

After that, you need to create a new folder called `data`, create a file named `users.yml`


export const responseUser = await fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/refs/heads/main/dozzle/data/users.yml");
export const contentUser = await responseUser.text();

<Code code={contentUser} lang="yml" title="data/users.yml" />

Once the configuration is complete, you can run the following command

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
