<WarnBanner />

Create a folder in which to place the dozzle data.

You can create a first file named `docker-compose.yml` and put the following content in it

<ShowCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/refs/heads/main/dozzle/docker-compose.yml" language="yml" title="docker-compose.yml" />

After that, you need to create a new folder called `data`, create a file named `users.yml`

<ShowCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/refs/heads/main/dozzle/data/users.yml" language="yml" title="data/users.yml" />

You should have the following file tree

<FileTree>
- docker-compose.yml
- data
    - users.yml
</FileTree>

Once the configuration is complete, you can run the following command

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
