Create a folder in which to place the umami data.

You can create a first file named `docker-compose.yml` and put the following content in it


<ShowCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/main/umami/docker-compose.yml" language="yml" title="docker-compose.yml" />

You need to configure your environnement variable


<ShowCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/main/umami/.env" language="txt" title=".env" />

Once the configuration is complete, you can run the following command

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
