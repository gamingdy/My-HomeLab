Create a folder in which to place the umami data.

You can create a first file named `compose.yaml` and put the following content in it


<ShowCode url="umami/compose.yaml" language="yml" title="compose.yaml" isGithub />

You need to configure your environnement variable


<ShowCode url="umami/.env" language="txt" title=".env" isGithub />

Once the configuration is complete, you can run the following command

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
