Create a folder in which to place the nginx proxy manager data.

You can create a first file named `docker-compose.yml` and put the following content in it


export const responseNpm = await fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/main/nginx-proxy/docker-compose.yml");
export const contentNpm = await responseNpm.text();

<Code code={contentNpm} lang="yml" title="docker-compose.yml" />

You can also create a file named `_hsts.conf`

export const responsHsts = await fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/main/nginx-proxy/_hsts.conf");
export const contentHsts = await responsHsts.text();

<Code code={contentHsts} lang="txt" title="_hsts.conf" mark={13}/>

It is recommended to edit the highlighted line with a different server name
