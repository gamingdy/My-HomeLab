Create a folder in which to place the nginx proxy manager data.

You can create a first file named `docker-compose.yml` and put the following content in it

<ShowCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/refs/heads/main/nginx-proxy/docker-compose.yml" language="yml" title="docker-compose.yml" />

You can also create a file named `_hsts.conf`

<ShowCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/refs/heads/main/nginx-proxy/_hsts.conf" language="txt" title="_hsts.conf" mark={13} />

It is recommended to edit the highlighted line with a different server name

Once the configuration is complete, you can run the following command

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The admin panel will be available at: http://serverip:81
The default user/password are:

user : `admin@example.com`

password: `changeme`
