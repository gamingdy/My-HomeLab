Create a folder in which to place the homepage data.

You can create a first file named `compose.yaml` and put the following content in it

<ShowCode url="homepage/compose.yaml" title="compose.yaml" language="yml" isGithub />

After that you need to configuration your environnement variable


Once the configuration is complete, you can run the following command

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
