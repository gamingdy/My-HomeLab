Create a folder in which to place the lynx data.

You can create a first file named `docker-compose.yml` and put the following content in it

<ShowCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/main/lynx/docker-compose.yml" language="yml" title="docker-compose.yml" />

After that you need to configuration your environnement variable


<ShowCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/main/lynx/.env" language="yml" title=".env" />


<ShowCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/main/lynx/db.env" language="yml" title="db.env" />

Once the configuration is complete, you can run the following command

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
