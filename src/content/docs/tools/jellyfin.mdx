import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";


Create a folder in which to place the jellyfin data.

You can create a first file named `docker-compose.yml` and put the following content in it


export const responseJellyfin = await fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/main/jellyfin/docker-compose.yml");
export const contentJellyfin = await responseJellyfin.text();
 
<Code code={contentJellyfin} lang="yml" title="docker-compose.yml" />
