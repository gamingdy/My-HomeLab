Create a folder in which to place the your spotify data.

You can create a first file named `docker-compose.yml` and put the following content in it

<ShowCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/main/spotify/docker-compose.yml" language="yml" title="docker-compose.yml" />

After that you need to configuration your environnement variable, you can see [here](https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-the-spotify-application) how to create a spotify application

<ShowCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/main/spotify/client.env" language="txt" title="client.env" />

<ShowCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamingdy/My-HomeLab/main/spotify/server.env" language="txt" title="server.env" />

Once the configuration is complete, you can run the following command

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
